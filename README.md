## Description 
The avatar of the practice can be controlled with three buttons that appear on screen: 
- SayHi: the avatar will wave his hand "saying hi" and he will look towards the moving hand.
- Jump: the avatar will keep running and each 2sec will jump (an invisible obstacle).
- Stop: both actions will stop.

If you press once "SayHi" or "Jump" option, the avatar will start doing the indicated movement. If you press the button again, it will stop doing the action. 

## Difficulties 
The main difficulties encountred had been: creating a new object that makes the avatar wave his hand and control the precise movement; control the look of the avatar (in order to look at his hand only while he is waving it).
